# 🛡️ Keylogger Implementation (For Educational Purposes Only)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a basic **keylogger** works using Python. It is strictly developed for **ethical testing**, **security research**, and **awareness purposes**. Understanding how keyloggers operate helps in designing better defense mechanisms against them.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a Python-based keylogger that logs keystrokes into a file for educational demonstration.

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [`pynput`](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library

### 📦 Installation

Install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install pynput

🧠 How It Works
The script uses the pynput.keyboard.Listener to capture key presses.

It logs all keystrokes into a local file named key_log.txt.

Special keys like space, enter, etc., are logged in brackets (e.g., [Key.space]).

📝 Usage Instructions
🔧 Step 1: Run the Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python keylogger.py
🔧 Step 2: Type Anywhere
You can type in any window — the script logs all keystrokes to key_log.txt.

⛔ Step 3: Stop the Keylogger
Press the Esc key to stop the keylogger (if using the updated version).

OR close the terminal window / stop the process from Task Manager if Ctrl + C doesn't work.

📂 Output Example (key_log.txt)

Edit
Keylogger Started (For Educational Use Only)

🛠️ Features
Logs both alphanumeric and special keys.

Runs continuously until stopped.

Simple to modify and extend.
